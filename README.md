# eMemory
A little memory down Emory - all my relevant coursework for these last 4 years

In this repository, you will find all the code I have ever written for college courses (*outside of those done in hacker rank and other third party sites*). 

### Things to Note:
My coding conventions have not always been detailed, and some of these assignments are from a time when I touched code for the first time or during a time when I was not even 'legal'. To perserve the authenticity of my progress, I have uploaded each piece as I have submitted them. I doubt anyone will really look through them so if you discover something about me, you deserve to know it. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥

** IF YOU ARE A CURRENT EMORY STUDENT, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HONOR CODE VIOLATIONS. DO NOT LOOK OVER ANY OF MY ASSIGNMENTS BEFORE OBTAINING THE PROPER PERMISSION FROM YOUR PROFESSOR **

(With that said, some assignments are not uploaded as of 10/20/2023 since I am currently taking those courses)

### 1. CS 170 Introduction to CS
As the name suggests, this course introduced basic computer science concepts (for loops, while loops, if/else, and recurssion) using JAVA and turtle.

### 2. CS 171 Introduction to CS II
Assignments consists of writing more complex programs to further develop logic fluency using basic JAVA components.

### 3. CS 253 Data Structures & Algorithms
Sadly all the coding assignments were done on HackerRank. I have however, included all the basic implementations of data structures for JAVA. Please enjoy them at your leisure.

### 4. CS 255 Computer Architecture
This course is an introduction to C and direct hardware manipulation. Assignments include basic C implementations, usage of malloc/calloc, and linux-ubuntu based assembly. 

### 5. CS 329 Computational Linguistics
A course on building interactive AIs - specifically conversational AIs, the main project is on https://github.com/csdropout1/kindred, but other assignments involving working directly with EmoraSTDM and GPT api calls.

### 6. CS 370 Practicum 
https://github.com/csdropout1/musAIc

### 7. CS 470 Data Mining
Assignments are practical implementations of basic datamining techniques like clustering, dimensional reduction, and data cleaning using python. The final project, which involves creating a custom search engine based on HITs, pageRank, and simRank can be found on https://github.com/csdropout1/edusearch.
