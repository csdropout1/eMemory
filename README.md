A little memory down Emory - all my relevant coursework for these last 4 years

In this repository, you will find all the code I have ever written for college courses (*outside of those done in hacker rank and other third party sites*). 

### Things to Note:
My coding conventions have not always been detailed, and some of these assignments are from a time when I touched code for the first time or during a time when my mind was not at its best - to say the least. To perserve the authenticity of my progress, I have uploaded each piece as I have submitted them. I doubt anyone will really look through them so if you discover something about me, you deserve to know it. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥

** IF YOU ARE A CURRENT EMORY STUDENT, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HONOR CODE VIOLATIONS. DO NOT LOOK OVER ANY OF MY ASSIGNMENTS BEFORE OBTAINING THE PROPER PERMISSION FROM YOUR PROFESSOR **

### 1. CS 170 Introduction to CS
As the name suggests, this course introduced basic computer science concepts (for loops, while loops, if/else, and recurssion) using JAVA and turtle.

### 2. CS 171 Introduction to CS II
Assignments consists of writing more complex programs to further develop logic fluency using basic JAVA components.

### 3. CS 253 Data Structures & Algorithms
Sadly all the coding assignments were done on HackerRank. I have however, included all the basic implementations of data structures for JAVA. Please enjoy them at your leisure.

### 4. CS 255 Computer Architecture
This course is an introduction to C and direct hardware manipulation. Assignments include basic C implementations, usage of malloc/calloc, and linux-ubuntu based assembly. 

### 5. CS 329 Computational Linguistics
A course on building interactive AIs - specifically conversational AIs, the main project is on https://github.com/csdropout1/kindred, but other assignments involving working directly with EmoraSTDM and GPT api calls.

### 6. CS 334 Machine Learning
Machine learning basic. Relevant works includes implementing all the rudimentary models (KNN, DTC, Perceptron etc). Optimization and analysis of these models were covered in the course but was only superficially evaluated on assigments.

### 7. CS 350 Systems 
Basic OS functionality and memory manipulation through the use of C. Relevant work includes recreating malloc and basic zip files.

### 8. CS 370 Practicum 
https://github.com/csdropout1/musAIc

### 9. CS 385 AI Practicum
https://github.com/guard-ai

### 10. CS 470 Data Mining
Assignments are practical implementations of basic datamining techniques like clustering, dimensional reduction, and data cleaning using python. The final project, which involves creating a custom search engine based on HITs, pageRank, and simRank can be found on https://github.com/csdropout1/edusearch.

### 11. CS 485 Human-AI Interactive Design
Course covered techniques for building better AI products for users. Relevant work revolved around prompting, customer acquisition, and user compatibility. Link to final project: https://github.com/ningk7/HAI-Daemon-Assistant.

### 12. CS 485 Information Secrurity
Cryptography algorithms and theory. Algorithm implementations and real world analysis. Implemented basic ciphers, LSFRs, and evaluated ECC.
